# Multitasking in MS-DOS

This source code is circa late 90s. It was implemented using Turbo C++ on x86 architecture.

[MS-DOS](https://github.com/Microsoft/MS-DOS) is a non-preemptive, single-tasked operating system. This system offers primitives to support multitasking in DOS, memory management and synchronization constructs (semaphores, messages). It works using the concept of [Terminate and Stay Resident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminate_and_stay_resident_program) in DOS.

Read [How It Works](How_It_Works.md) to understand its inner working.
